# Rick and Morty Wonderland

## Netlify Link
Netlify link is available [here](https://updates--rick-and-morty-wonderland.netlify.app/).

### Why not Heroku
I think heroku is not really for a static site, there is no server required in this test. Hence deployed to Netlify.

## Project setup
1. Install dependencies
```
yarn install
```
2. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` for local development.

    Usually you will fill in the local/staging/dev api endpoint, but in this test we will just use the one api endpoint provided.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### _Compiles and minifies for production_
```
yarn build
```

### _Lints and fixes files_
```
yarn lint
```

### Why not parcel
Initially I have setup Vue3 with Parcel, and it works locally with no issue. You can check this [original repo configured using Parcel + Vue3 here](https://github.com/katexue/rick-and-morty-wonderland/tree/parcel). The setup and local dev instructions are in `README.md` file

The reason I switched to Vue Cli half way throught the test is that I had issue deploying to both Heroku and Netlify.

I have done various trials and research, including build then host locally using node server. In the end I think the root issue is caused by Parcel Build.

I have found [this issue](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/1656) on Parcel github repo which is the exact issue I has when build and deploy.

I then tried the work around mentioned in that issue. Then it threw a new error which I found out to be an [exisiting bug with Parcel V2](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/5814). The last comment mentioning the issue exists was posted 17 days ago.

I also downgraded to the _working version_ mentioned in the first issue comments, but keep getting issues/bugs related to that specific parcel version.

In the end I felt I have spent good amount of time on this and probably it doesn't worth me spending more time just trying to debug it and host it. I still had half of the test to be finished and I think that is more important.

It certainly might be me just didn't config the whole thing properly as well. Keen to get some adivce from you.

## Other Notes and Design Decisions
1. `Rick and Morty Wonderland` title in heading is an actual font face ðŸ¦„
2. `Feeling lucky?` will open a random character's modal window
3. Search `Kate` to check some error message 
4. Rick and Morty has special glow around avatar, so special.
5. Tested on:
    - Chrome latest
    - Firefox latest
    - Safari latest
    - iPhone X (my phone)
    - Major mobile viewport using Chrome dev tool
6. It's definately not perfect, it was a great learning experience. I appreciate any feedback!
